# Introduction

The ability to monitor and predict crop yields in developing countries is critical to the sucessful adaptation to changes in our climate. Increased temperatures and variability has already been linked to losses in maize and wheat yields (-3.8 and 5.5% respectively)and crop prices globally [@Lobell616]. Althought much effort has been placed on modeling the spatial distribution of these shifts, less effort has been placed on how yields vary across space and time [@Ray2015]. Advances in remote sensing provide new avenues to monitor agricultural crop health at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, our ability to monitor changes in plant productivity is still limited in the more complex environments  common to many developing countries [@Mann2015]. 

One primary thrust of these efforts has evolved out of the index insurance space. Index insurance is...   
The main objectives of this project is to apply and compare statstical methods commonly applied these problems outside of the field of geography. In particular we will focus on the application of spatial panel regression to monitor spatio-temporal variability in wheat yields for Punjab and Haryana India at the district level for years `r paste(range(yield_ndvi$years, na.rm=T),collapse=' to ')`.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
